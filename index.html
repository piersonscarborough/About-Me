            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>
                    As a freelancer I provide professional photography, graphic design, and digital marketing services. As far as photography I work a lot of commercial shoots/events and my graphic design ranges from logos to brochures and even some infographics. Finally, I offer social media services as well.
